1. it will print 3 becuase traversing the array increased i to 3 which terminates the for loop. 
2. it will print out 150 which is the last element's discounted price. 
3. it will print 150 since it is the final price of the last element. \
4. it will return an array [50, 100, 150] 
5. Reference Error: since i is tye  let, does not exist outsie the for loop 
6. Reference Error: since disocuntedPrice is type let, therefore, it does not exist outside for loop. 
7. it will print out 150 
8. it will return an array [50, 100, 150] 
9. Referenc error, becuase i is not defined. 
10. it will print out 3
11. it will return an array [50, 100, 150], the arr address is constant, but we can still modify the content of the array. 
12. - student.name
    - student['Grad Year']
    - student.greeting()
    - student['Favorite Teacher']["name"]
    - student['courseLoad'][0]
13. - '32' since integers map to their direct string
    - 1 since string maps to integer
    - 3 since null equivilently 0 
    - '3null' since null becomes "null" 
    - 4 since true is 1, adding 3 becomes 4
    - 0 false is 0 and null is also 0 
    - 3undefined since undefined maps to 'undefined' 
    - NaN since it becomes undefined 
14. - true since '2' is converted as 2 which is greater than 1 
    - false both convert to integer then perform comparisoin
    - ture since '2' becomes 2 which equals to 2 
    - false since type do not match which return false when performing strict comparison 
    - true since Boolean(2) will be converted as true 
15. == comparison can convert types then perform comparision, === which is strict comparison has to make sure that type matches. 
16. 21, 45, 5, 2 
17. result will be [2, 4, 6]. Very similar to python's function as first class object that each push will append the result from what returned from function doSomething. doSomething will double an number which will double all elements inside the array. 
18. 1 4 3 2
